    "To complete this assignment, create a Jupyter notebook containing your solutions to the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Please specify whether the following arguments are true or false:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. ANNs are the only neural network architecture that perform reasonably well in real-world tasks.**\n",
    "* False\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The sample size of the training data is a hyperparameter of an ANN model.**\n",
    "* False\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. In the checkpoint, we covered two hyperparameters of ANNs: number of layers and number of neurons in the layers. But, there are also other hyperparameters of the model.**\n",
    "* True\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Output layer of an ANN can only contain one neuron.**\n",
    "* False. In regression, output will be one neuron, but in classification, the output will be the number of classes.\n",

    "### 2. We have data with 10 features and we designed an ANN to be trained on this data. If we have three layers with 512 neurons each in this ANN, how many parameters do we need to estimate?\n",
    "1. First layer: A neuron would have 10 features and 1 bias = 11 parameters. This would be multiplied by the other neurons 512. So 11 * 512 = 5,632\n",
    "2. Second layer: Each neuron would have 512 weights and 1 bias. So 513 * 512 = 262,656 parameters\n",
    "3. The third layer is the same as the second so another 262,656 parameters\n",
    "4. In total 5,632 + 262,656 + 262,656 = 530,944 parameters\n",

    "### 3. We have data with 100 features and we designed an ANN to be trained on this data. If in this ANN, we have three layers with 512, 256 and 10 neurons, how many parameters do we need to estimate?\n",
    "1. First layer: a neuron would have 100 features and 1 bias = 101 parameters. This would be multiplied by the other neurons. In total 101 * 512 = 51,712\n",
    "2. Second layer: 512 weights and 1 bias. 513 * 256 = 131,328\n",
    "3. Third layer: 256 weights and 1 bias. 257 * 10 = 2,570\n",
